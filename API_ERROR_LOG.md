# API Error Log

## Error Details
- **Date**: $(date)
- **Error Type**: Console Error
- **Error Message**: Failed to fetch contacts: 500
- **Location**: src/app/contacts/page.tsx (78:15) @ fetchContacts
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Environment**: Next.js 15.4.6 Turbopack (Development)

## Error Context
The error occurred in the `fetchContacts` function within the contacts page component. The API call to fetch contacts is returning a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating a server-side issue.

## Call Stack
1. `fetchContacts` from `src/app/contacts/page.tsx (78:15)`
2. `async*ContactsPage.useEffect` from `src/app/contacts/page.tsx (56:5)`

## Code Snippet
```typescript
76 |
77 |   if (!response.ok) {
> 78 |     throw new Error('Failed to fetch contacts: ${response.status}')
79 |   }
80 |
81 |   const data: ContactsResponse = await response.json()
```

## Next Steps
1. Check backend server logs for the root cause of the 500 error
2. Verify the contacts API endpoint is properly configured
3. Check database connectivity and query execution
4. Review the backend error handling for the contacts endpoint

## Investigation Results
- [x] Backend logs reviewed - Server was not running initially
- [x] API endpoint verified - Contacts endpoint requires authentication (404 expected without auth)
- [x] Database connectivity checked - Database is running and migrations completed successfully
- [x] Error resolved - Backend server is now running on port 8089

## Root Cause
The 500 error was caused by the backend Go server not being running. The frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:8089` but there was no server listening on that port.

## Solution Applied
1. Started the backend Go server using `go run cmd/server/main.go`
2. Server is now running on port 8089
3. Database migrations and seeding completed successfully
4. Fixed division by zero error in database logging by adding proper checks
5. Contacts API endpoint now working correctly with authentication
6. Successfully tested with JWT token - returns 268 contacts with full details

## Final Test Results
- ✅ Server running on port 8089
- ✅ Authentication working with JWT tokens
- ✅ Contacts endpoint returning 200 status
- ✅ Database queries executing successfully
- ✅ No more division by zero errors
- ✅ Full contact data with relationships returned
4. Health endpoint responding correctly

## Next Steps
The contacts endpoint requires authentication. To test it properly:
1. First authenticate via `/api/auth/login` to get a JWT token
2. Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests
3. The frontend should handle authentication before making API calls

## Status
- [x] Backend server started
- [x] Database connectivity verified
- [x] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Authentication flow tested
- [ ] Frontend integration verified
