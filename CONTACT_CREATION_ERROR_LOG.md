# Contact Creation Error Log

## Error Summary
- **Error**: "Failed to create contact" 
- **Location**: `src/components/contacts/create-contact-modal.tsx (70:13) @ createContact`
- **Date**: 2025-08-16
- **Frontend Port**: 3000 ✅ (FIXED)
- **Backend Port**: 8089

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs because the frontend is trying to create a contact without proper authentication.

## Debugging Steps Taken

### Step 1: Authentication System Setup ✅
- Created new authentication provider: `frontend/src/hooks/use-auth-provider.tsx`
- Updated all imports to use new provider
- Backend authentication confirmed working (tested with curl)

### Step 2: Port Issue Fixed ✅
- Frontend now running on port 3000 as required
- Killed processes on port 3000 and restarted with PORT=3000

### Step 3: Backend 500 Error Identified ✅
- Network tab shows 500 Internal Server Error from backend
- Authentication is working (Bearer token is being sent)
- Issue is in the backend contact creation endpoint
- Need to check backend logs and contact creation handler

### Step 4: Backend Handler Fixed ✅
- Updated CreateContact function to handle complex request structure
- Added CreateContactRequest struct to match frontend data
- Implemented transaction-based creation of contact + related records
- Fixed pointer handling for optional fields

### Step 5: UUID Validation Error Fixed ✅
- **SOLVED**: Used raw SQL instead of GORM Create method
- Raw SQL properly handles NULL values for company_id field
- Contact creation now works with simple requests
- HTTP 201 status returned successfully

### Step 6: Next Steps
- Test full contact creation with complex request (email addresses, etc.)
- Fix response data formatting issue
- Test frontend contact creation form

## Next Steps
1. Verify user authentication status
2. Check if token is in localStorage
3. Test API call with proper authentication
4. Fix any remaining issues

## Test Credentials
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: password123
- Token: [Will be retrieved from successful login]
