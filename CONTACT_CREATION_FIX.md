# Contact Creation Fix

## Issues Resolved

### 1. "Invalid token" Error
**Problem**: The frontend was getting "Invalid token" errors when trying to create contacts.

**Root Cause**: The user was not properly authenticated or the token was expired/invalid.

**Solution**: 
- Improved error handling in the frontend to provide better authentication feedback
- Added authentication checks before allowing contact creation
- Enhanced token validation with proper error messages
- Added automatic redirect to login page when authentication fails

### 2. "Failed to create email address" Error
**Problem**: The backend was failing to create email addresses due to foreign key constraint violations.

**Root Cause**: The database had conflicting foreign key constraints on polymorphic relationship tables. The `email_addresses`, `phone_numbers`, `addresses`, and `social_media_accounts` tables had foreign key constraints for multiple entity types (companies, contacts, leads, users) that were conflicting with each other.

**Solution**:
- Removed conflicting foreign key constraints from the database
- Updated GORM models to remove conflicting foreign key relationships
- Created a migration script to fix the database schema permanently

## Database Changes Made

### Foreign Key Constraints Removed

1. **Email Addresses Table**:
   - `fk_companies_email_addresses`
   - `fk_leads_email_addresses` 
   - `fk_users_email_addresses`

2. **Phone Numbers Table**:
   - `fk_companies_phone_numbers`
   - `fk_leads_phone_numbers`
   - `fk_users_phone_numbers`

3. **Addresses Table**:
   - `fk_companies_addresses`
   - `fk_leads_addresses`
   - `fk_users_addresses`

4. **Social Media Accounts Table**:
   - `fk_companies_social_media_accounts`
   - `fk_leads_social_media_accounts`
   - `fk_users_social_media_accounts`

### GORM Model Changes

Removed conflicting foreign key relationships from:
- `EmailAddress` model
- `PhoneNumber` model  
- `Address` model
- `SocialMediaAccount` model

## Frontend Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Authentication-specific error handling
   - Automatic redirect to login for authentication failures

2. **Authentication Checks**:
   - Added user authentication verification before form submission
   - Authentication required modal when user is not logged in
   - Token validation improvements

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Automatic cleanup of invalid tokens
   - Smooth redirect to login page

## Testing

The fix was verified by:
1. Testing authentication flow
2. Testing contact creation with all related entities (email, phone, address, social media)
3. Verifying that contacts are properly created in the database
4. Testing error scenarios and error handling

## Migration

To apply these fixes to a fresh database, run the migration script:
```sql
-- Run the migration from: backend/cmd/migrate/fix_polymorphic_constraints.sql
```

## Notes

- The polymorphic relationships now work correctly without foreign key constraint conflicts
- Only the relevant foreign key constraints remain (e.g., `fk_contacts_email_addresses` for contacts)
- The system maintains data integrity through application-level validation
- Authentication flow is more robust with better error handling
