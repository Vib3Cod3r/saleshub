# Quick Start Guide - Development Log System

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you quickly set up and start using the development log system for your SalesHub CRM project.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- Git repository initialized
- Your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended)

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

### 1. Create Your First Daily Log
```bash
cd scripts
node create-log-entry.js daily
```

This will:
- Create a new daily log file with today's date
- Pre-fill it with your git commits from today
- Open it in your default editor

### 2. Start Time Tracking
```bash
cd scripts
node time-tracker.js interactive
```

Or use individual commands:
```bash
# Start tracking development work
node time-tracker.js start "Development" "Working on user authentication"

# Stop tracking
node time-tracker.js stop

# Export time data to daily log
node time-tracker.js export
```

### 3. Create Weekly Summary
```bash
cd scripts
node create-log-entry.js weekly
```

### 4. Generate Reports
```bash
# Generate monthly report
node generate-summary.js monthly 2024 january

# Generate yearly report
node generate-summary.js yearly 2024

# Show general statistics
node generate-summary.js stats
```

## üìù Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
1. **Start time tracking**:
   ```bash
   node time-tracker.js start "Development" "Daily development work"
   ```

2. **Create daily log** (if not already created):
   ```bash
   node create-log-entry.js daily
   ```

3. **Set today's goals** in the log file

### During Development
1. **Track different activities**:
   ```bash
   node time-tracker.js start "Debugging" "Fixing authentication bug"
   # ... work on the task ...
   node time-tracker.js stop
   
   node time-tracker.js start "Testing" "Writing unit tests"
   # ... work on testing ...
   node time-tracker.js stop
   ```

2. **Update your daily log** with:
   - Tasks completed
   - Issues encountered
   - Progress made
   - Files modified

### End of Day
1. **Export time tracking data**:
   ```bash
   node time-tracker.js export
   ```

2. **Complete your daily log** with:
   - Final time breakdown
   - Tomorrow's plan
   - Notes and observations

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/development-logs/
   git commit -m "Add daily development log for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ```

## üéØ Weekly Workflow

### End of Week
1. **Create weekly summary**:
   ```bash
   node create-log-entry.js weekly
   ```

2. **Review the week's progress**:
   - Major accomplishments
   - Issues resolved
   - Lessons learned
   - Next week's goals

3. **Generate weekly report**:
   ```bash
   node generate-summary.js monthly $(date +%Y) $(date +%B | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
   ```

## üöÄ Feature Development Workflow

### Start New Feature
1. **Create feature log**:
   ```bash
   node create-log-entry.js feature "User Authentication"
   ```

2. **Plan the feature**:
   - Requirements and scope
   - Technical implementation plan
   - User stories

### During Feature Development
1. **Track feature-specific time**:
   ```bash
   node time-tracker.js start "Feature: User Auth" "Implementing login form"
   ```

2. **Update feature log daily** with:
   - Implementation progress
   - Technical challenges
   - Files modified
   - Testing results

### Complete Feature
1. **Finalize feature log** with:
   - Deployment details
   - Performance metrics
   - Lessons learned
   - Success metrics

- **Features**: `docs/development-logs/logs/features/`

## üìà Tips for Effective Logging

### 1. Be Consistent
- Log every day you work
- Use consistent activity categories
- Update logs in real-time

### 2. Be Specific
- Include file paths when mentioning code changes
- Describe issues with enough detail to understand later
- Link to relevant documentation or resources

### 3. Track Time Accurately
- Start/stop time tracking for each activity
- Don't forget to stop tracking when taking breaks
- Export time data to logs regularly

### 4. Follow DRY Principles
- Reference your project's DRY rules in logs
- Note when you refactor code to reduce duplication
- Track code quality improvements

### 5. Learn from Patterns
- Review weekly/monthly reports regularly
- Identify productivity patterns
- Adjust your workflow based on insights

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script not found**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the scripts directory
cd scripts
ls -la *.js
```

**Permission denied**:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.js
```

**Editor not opening**:
```bash
# Set your editor explicitly
export EDITOR=code
node create-log-entry.js daily
```

**Git integration not working**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in a git repository
git status
```

### Getting Help
- Check the main README: `docs/development-logs/README.md`
- Run help commands: `node create-log-entry.js --help`
- Review the DRY rules: `DRY_RULES.md`

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Start with daily logging** for a week
2. **Add time tracking** to your workflow
3. **Create your first weekly summary**
4. **Generate your first monthly report**
5. **Customize the system** to fit your needs

Remember: The goal is to make logging a natural part of your development process, not an additional burden. Start small and build up your logging habits over time.
