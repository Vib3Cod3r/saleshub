# Internal Server Error Log - SalesHub CRM

## Issue Summary
**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Issue**: Internal server error when trying to connect to the host  
**Frequency**: Multiple occurrences reported  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The frontend service was experiencing issues and returning "Internal Server Error" instead of proper HTML content.

### Technical Details
1. **Backend Service**: Running correctly on port 8089 and responding to API calls
2. **Database Service**: PostgreSQL running correctly on port 5432
3. **Frontend Service**: Next.js development server was experiencing issues
4. **Service Dependencies**: Frontend depends on backend API endpoints for data fetching

### Error Flow
1. User navigates to frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Frontend returns "Internal Server Error" instead of proper HTML
3. Backend API endpoints are working correctly
4. Issue was isolated to frontend service

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Fix
```bash
# Stop the problematic frontend processes
pkill -f "next dev"

# Restart the frontend service
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test frontend connectivity
curl -s http://localhost:3000
# Expected: Proper HTML content instead of "Internal Server Error"

# Test backend connectivity
curl -s http://localhost:8089/health
# Expected: {"message":"SalesHub CRM API is running","status":"ok"}
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Service Monitoring
- Implement health checks for both frontend and backend services
- Add service status indicators in the UI
- Create automated service restart on failure

### 2. Development Workflow
- Update documentation to include service startup requirements
- Create a single command to start all services
- Add service status check to the startup script

### 3. Error Handling
- Improve frontend error handling for network failures
- Add retry logic for failed API calls
- Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Future Improvements

### 1. Service Management
```bash
# Proposed: Single command to start all services
./start-all.sh
```

### 2. Health Check Endpoint
```go
// Add to backend
GET /api/health
```

### 3. Frontend Error Handling
```typescript
// Add service status check
const checkServiceHealth = async () => {
  try {
    await apiClient.getHealth()
    return true
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Backend service unavailable:', error)
    return false
  }
}
```

## Notes
- This issue occurs frequently during development when services are stopped manually
- The backend service requires manual startup in development mode
- Consider implementing a development mode that automatically starts all required services
- Add clear error messages to guide users when services are unavailable

## Resolution Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All services are now running and responding:

### Current Service Status
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: ✅ Running on port 5432
- **Backend API**: ✅ Running on port 8089 and responding to requests
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on port 3000 and serving proper HTML content

### Service URLs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8089
- Database: localhost:5432
- PgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

### Root Cause Confirmed
The internal server error was caused by the frontend Next.js development server experiencing issues. The backend was working correctly, but the frontend was returning "Internal Server Error" instead of proper HTML content. Restarting the frontend service resolved the issue.

### Resolution Steps Applied
1. **Identified Issue**: Frontend returning "Internal Server Error"
2. **Verified Backend**: Confirmed backend was working correctly
3. **Restarted Frontend**: Killed existing processes and restarted with `npm run dev`
4. **Verified Fix**: Confirmed frontend now returns proper HTML content
