# Internal Server Error Log - SalesHub CRM

## Issue Summary
**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Issue**: Internal server error when trying to connect to the host  
**Frequency**: Multiple occurrences reported  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The backend service was not running, causing the frontend to receive internal server errors when trying to make API calls to `http://localhost:8089`.

### Technical Details
1. **Docker Compose Configuration**: The backend service is configured with a `production` profile in `docker-compose.yml`
2. **Development Setup**: The backend needs to be started manually using the `restart_services.sh` script
3. **Service Dependencies**: Frontend depends on backend API endpoints for data fetching

### Error Flow
1. User navigates to `/deals` page
2. Frontend makes API call to `GET /api/crm/deals`
3. Backend service not running on port 8089
4. Network error occurs
5. Frontend displays internal server error

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Fix
```bash
# Start the backend service
cd /home/ted/cursor/saleshub
./restart_services.sh backend
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test backend connectivity
curl -s http://localhost:8089/api/auth/me
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (service is running)
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Service Monitoring
- Implement health checks for both frontend and backend services
- Add service status indicators in the UI
- Create automated service restart on failure

### 2. Development Workflow
- Update documentation to include service startup requirements
- Create a single command to start all services
- Add service status check to the startup script

### 3. Error Handling
- Improve frontend error handling for network failures
- Add retry logic for failed API calls
- Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Future Improvements

### 1. Service Management
```bash
# Proposed: Single command to start all services
./start-all.sh
```

### 2. Health Check Endpoint
```go
// Add to backend
GET /api/health
```

### 3. Frontend Error Handling
```typescript
// Add service status check
const checkServiceHealth = async () => {
  try {
    await apiClient.getHealth()
    return true
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Backend service unavailable:', error)
    return false
  }
}
```

## Notes
- This issue occurs frequently during development when services are stopped manually
- The backend service requires manual startup in development mode
- Consider implementing a development mode that automatically starts all required services
- Add clear error messages to guide users when services are unavailable

## Resolution Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All services are now running and responding:

### Current Service Status
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: ✅ Running on port 5432
- **Backend API**: ✅ Running on port 8089 and responding to requests
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on port 3000 (correct port)

### Service URLs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8089
- Database: localhost:5432
- PgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

### Root Cause Confirmed
The internal server error was caused by the backend service not being running. The frontend was trying to make API calls to `http://localhost:8089` but receiving network errors because no service was listening on that port.
